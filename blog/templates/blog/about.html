                    Hello! I'm the author behind Ink & Well, a personal blog focused on minimalist design, thoughtful
                    writing, and creative exploration.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    This space was created to share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings in a clean, distraction-free
                    environment. I believe that good design doesn't have to be complicated, and good writing should
                    speak for itself.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    With a background in both design and writing, I'm fascinated by the intersection of visual and
                    verbal communication. I've worked in various creative fields and now focus on sharing what I've
                    learned through this blog.
