                    Hello! I'm <strong class="fw-bold">Marcos Alves</strong>, the author behind this blog, a personal
                    blog focused on
                    minimalist design,
                    thoughtful
                    writing, and creative exploration.

                    This space was created to share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings in a clean, distraction-free
                    environment. I believe that good design doesn't have to be complicated, and good writing should
                    speak for itself.
